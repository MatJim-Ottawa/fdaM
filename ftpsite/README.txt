These changes affect only  Matlab versions of the functions :

All functions and examples have been checked for Matlab Version 7,
Release R2011a.

Most of these functions are described and their usage illustrated in
J. O. Ramsay, G. Hooker, and S Graves (2009) Functional Data Analysis
in Matlab and R, Springer.

However, the functions are continually evolving and increasing in number
as more and more new basis systems are added as well as new
capabilities.   Unfortunately, this evolution has now outstripped
this text, and greatly gone beyond the last version of the manual
in the file FDAFunctions.pdf.  The latter should be regarded as of
little use now.  To see what has been added, the only strategy now is
to look at the documentation found in the header lines of each
function that might interest you.

Most of the functions have their counterparts in R, and these may be
found in the R-project CRAN repository, accessible through the
R Project for Statistical Computing website http://www.r-project.org/.

I do all of my development work in Matlab, so that new functions will
appear first in my personal ftp site
http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/

These functions are accompanied by a number of examples drawn from
various published papers and books, and at current count number
fourteen.  For most of these files, the numbers of analyses
considerably exceed what is reported in the book cited above, and
are therefore an extensive resource on how to set up a functional
data analysis.

A general description of functional data analysis may be found in
the website www.functionaldata.org.
